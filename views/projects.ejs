                <p>There was a morning when I heard my mom complained about the plants she has taken care of didn't growed well. She also mentioned that this plants used to growing well before it was grafted from her friend. For the next few days, we kept considering the possible cause by comparing how the environment differed. Finally, among all the ideas, one is that we lived on six floor of an apartment, while my mom's friend used to raise them in her yard. This doesn't make sense at first, since nobody believe this is the key. However, after moving the plants to the ground for a few days, they became healthy and lively. We think the difference in the altitude results in lots of factors: humidity, sunshine, ultraviolet ray, temperature. There are also other factors like enriched soil, watering frequency.</p>

                <p>This is how I am inspired of the importance of using data to help in our lifes. The world is full of information that could be used to explain what happened around us. I always have such kind of questions: Why some people are more energetic everyday? Why some people are less easily to catch a cold? Why some people build their muscle faster when working out? The answers can be found in each detail of our life, while some of which are just incredible. This is exactly what scientists do: when they are facing a problem, they collect enough data, analysis them to discover the regularities and give it an explanation. But mostly, people don't know how to collect the data; even they have the data, they don't know how to use it. It could be hard to discover some of them and find out the true reason.</p>

                <p>My idea is set up a system that allows people their own topic, and everyone who is involved is encouraged to share his own data. With more and more data we collected, we could start our analysis. This is where machine learning could step in. With the progress in machine learning, it reveals may return interesting and useful result. </p>
                <p>Recently, there are already companies data analysis with machine learning to guide instituions with their business. This is fantasitic. But individual also want the chance to contribute data and to understand their life more. Therefore, I build the DataLoop - a loop that collects data from people, makes use of the data, and returns something valuable back to them.</p>

            <p>This is a prototype of my idea. Now it could only accepts at most eight factors for analysis and data of integer, floating number, and date. The machine learning in the backgroung only includes basic algorithm like k-Means and regression. In the future, I would like to make it more scalable (more factors and also cross-topic), more data sources (image, text), and more ways to learn about them (support vector machine, neural network).</p>

                <p>Sometimes we read about or hear about interesting places across the world. We want to go some day but forget this place few days later. This app help people bookmark the locations with fascinating stories or pictures. People could view their dreaming places on map and plan trip accordingly. For example, you heard of Golden Gate Bridge, Ferry Building, Coit Tower, and marked these places on map. On some weekend during your intership, you select marked places around San Francisco, then the app will find a shortest path leading you to every place.</p>

                <p>This is the typical Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP), which is known as NP hard. There are several algorithms for this problem. First is the Brute Force solution that loop through each possible path and find the minimum. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt">2-Opt</a> solution that switch a pair of edges each time and keep track of the minimum. In practical, when a user select lots of places, the execution could take a long time. In this problem, we want to find the "good enough" solution with heuristic method: "randomly" chooses a pair of edges to switch. But this easily stuck at a local minimum and never reaches the optimal solution.</p>

                <p>Simulated Annealing method is a statistical way for solving most optimization problem. In simulated annealing we keep a temperature variable to simulate this heating process. We initially set it high and then allow it to slowly 'cool' as the algorithm runs. While this temperature variable is high the algorithm will be allowed, with more frequency, to accept solutions that are worse than our current solution. This gives the algorithm the ability to jump out of any local optimums it finds itself in early on in execution. As the temperature is reduced so is the chance of accepting worse solutions, therefore allowing the algorithm to gradually focus in on a area of the search space in which hopefully, a close to optimum solution can be found. <sup><a href="http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/simulated-annealing-algorithm-for-beginners/6">[1]</a></sup></p>

                <p>Here is another divide and conquer solution I developed: group points bottom-up, and conduct general TSP algorithm top-down: first, bring close points together as one group (cluster) by defining a distance benchmark. When a new point is added into a group, the group center is updated. Repeat this process by regarding each group as a point until the number of points is under some small number. Now running TSP algorithm starting from the highest level and then to lower level. Since TSP has O(n!) complexity, this will exponentially reduce the running time.</p>

                <p>This is an extension from one of my academic project on iOS. It could be downloaded and run either on an Xcode siulator or a real iOS device (Apple developer account required). It failed to be released because of copyrigh issue :(</p>

                <p>Two players could connect via Bluetooth or Apple Game Center. During a two-player game, one device are selected as the server to decide the game logic. The rules are like original Tetris, but two players are playing on the same field at the same time. They also share one Next shape, so who drops current shape fast will get Next shape. Sometimes blocks in a shape has properties, such as a Bomb that will blow up surrounding blocks when it is dropped. When a row is removed, each player obtains score based on his number of removing blocks. Finally when the game ends, who has more scores wins!</p>

                <p>I start my undergrad study as a finance student, and this is the first completly working program with GUI I built up after I switched into Computer Science. It really means a lot to me. By that time I still didn't know how to use version control. Github is just somewhere storing code to me, so I just finish everything and upload the project at one time.</p>
